## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Abhishek Saxena

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building robust infrastructure, clean systems, and tools that scale. Right now, I'm working on my Masterâ€™s in Computer Engineering [@TheGeorgeWashingtonUniversity](https://github.com/gwuniversity), diving into intelligent systems and machine learning.

ðŸ’¼ Previously [@Fidelity](https://github.com/fidelity), I led a team to ship a 401(k) optimization MVP projected to impact millions. I also built internal dashboards, helped streamline onboarding systems, and worked on core infra. Before that, I built logging platforms [@TuneHQ](https://github.com/TuneHQ) and worked with a chunk of the database layer [@Frappe](https://github.com/frappe).

ðŸ›  Tools I reach for often:

**Python**, **Java**, **C++**, **AngularJS**  
**FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, **Kubernetes**,  
**Docker**, **PyTorch**, **AWS**, **GCP**

ðŸŒ± I'm always tinkering with new ideas. One I'm proud of:
- ðŸŽ¨ [PaletteNet](https://github.com/saxenabhishek/PaletteNet-Implementation): A deep learning model that recolors images using custom palettes â€” built the dataset, training loop, and everything in between.

If you're building something ambitious, curious, or just weird â€” let's talk.
